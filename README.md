# Python-Adventure-Engine
A python-based text adventure engine


## Plan:
This is a text-adventure engine which will be able to parse some form of JSON or other object-based data structure into a playable text adventure

This is aimed at being compatible with micropython devices, so I can run it via my TTY, but should also work with anything that has string in/out capabilities.


I've peeked at a bit of the King's Quest source code to get a vague idea of how it handled things, and that has guided my main thoughts on the idea.
